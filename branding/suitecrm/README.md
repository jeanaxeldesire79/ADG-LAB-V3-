# SuiteCRM Branding
Mount path: ./branding/suitecrm → /branding

## Steps
1. Replace `logos/login_logo.png` with your real login/logo asset.
2. Replace `logos/pdf_header.png` and `logos/pdf_footer.png` for quote/invoice templates.
3. In SuiteCRM (Admin → System Settings):
   - Set **System Name**, **Logo** (point to uploaded file), choose theme.
4. In **PDF Manager**, edit templates and select header/footer images accordingly.

Tips: PNG 600–1200px wide for headers; keep files <200KB.
